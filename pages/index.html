# Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format that converts to HTML.

## By typing different characters and punctuation, you can **bold**, _italicize_, [link](http://thisismarkdown.com/) your text, and display images.

### Bold
Wrap words with two asterisks:

```markdown
**I am bold.**
```

### Italic
Wrap words with an underscore:

```markdown
_I am italic._
```

### Links
Wrap word(s) in square brackets and the link in parentheses:

```markdown
[I am a [link](http://thisismarkdown.com/)
```

### Images
Like a text link, but with an exclamation point at the beginning:

```markdown
![Optional Alt Text](/img/example.gif "Optional title")
```

_Note: You **must** link directly to an image, i.e. ending in `.gif`, `.jpg`, etc._

![This is used for the alt attribute.](https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5029/5658551241_8852d44b38_o.gif "This is used for the title attribute.")

### New Lines
To create a new line, you need to end with two empty spaces (shown as black boxes below):

```
This will be on the first line🁢🁢
and this will be on the second line
```

### Headings
Using the `#` symbol you can set **H3** through **H6** headings. Unfortunately, **H1** and **H2** aren't working right now.

```markdown
### This is an H3
#### This is an H4
```

## More Options

### Bulleted Lists
Add a dash `-` in front of each line:

```markdown
- Item One
- Item Two
- Item Three
```

### Numbered Lists
Add a number and period in front of each line:

```markdown
1. Item One
1. Item Two
1. Item Three
```

_Note: That's not a typo. Using only `1.` will still convert to a proper numbered list, which makes reordering lists a lot easier_

### Block Quotes
Add a  ` > ` at the beginning of a paragraph to quote it:

```markdown
> this line will look like the quote below
```

> this is what a blockquote looks like

### Inline Code
Wrap text in a single backtick at the top left of your keyboard:

```markdown
`border-radius: 3px;`
```

### Code Block
Wrap code with triple backticks, and add the language name like so:

```html
<section class="row">
  <a class="btn mr1 mb1">Primary</a>
  <a class="btn btn--secondary mr1 mb1">Secondary</a>
  <a class="btn btn--outline mr1 mb1">Outline</a>
  <a class="btn disabled">Disabled</a>
</section>
```

### Horizontal Rules
To create a horizontal line for separating content use:

```
 *** OR ---
```

### Tables
Using vertical lines `|`, you can even create tables:

| Making      |  Markdown   |   Tables |
|-------------|:-----------:|---------:|
| This column |   This one  | And this |
| is left     |  is set to  | is right |
| align       | be centered |  aligned |

The markdown to create this _(notice the use of `:` to indicate alignment)_:

```markdown
| Making      |  Markdown   |   Tables |
|-------------|:-----------:|---------:|
| This column |   This one  | And this |
| is left     |  is set to  | is right |
| align       | be centered |  aligned |
```
